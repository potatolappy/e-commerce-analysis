**Tools**

Tools used: 
- Jupyter Notebook, better suited for narrative story telling
- SQLite (DB Browser), somehow the dataset provided is in .db not .sql, so will be using this one

**Some key highlights of the project**

- considering which dataset to be manipulated or not using z-scores parameter
- cleaning null values
- formatting datatypes in SQL
- some visualization using seaborne

**Objective:**

1. Revenue generated by seller in each city
2. Best selling product category in each city
3. average logistic cost in each city

**Cleaning process**

1. inspecting shape and general info (done in Python)
2. inspecting null values (done in Python)
3. inspecting inconsistent datatype (done in SQL)
4. inspecting duplicates (done in Python)
5. inspecting outlier (done in python)

the analysis can be viewed at ```olist_analysis.ipynb```
